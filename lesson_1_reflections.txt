was introduced?

it was easy to compare rather than looking each line manually

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

We can restore to any point if some problem arises due to faulty changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

There will be more meaningful versions but with a possibility of human error

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Logical collection of files in a repository should be saved together in a single commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log give all commit with id, timestamp, author and change message. git diff can be used on 2 commit ids 
to see the changes for every file in repository among the 2 versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

With git, we can always restore to previous versions which were not having the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For all code projects that i will work on
