What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder is created and now all files present in the repository will be tracked by git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is intermediate area between working directory and repository.
When we create a new repository, then through the help of staging area, we can choose which 
files form working directory should be added to repository in the particular commit. 
Thus, having one logical change per commit.
